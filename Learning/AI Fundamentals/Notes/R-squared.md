# R-squared
**Overview**
Description:: A measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line.

## Note

$R^2$ , the coefficient of determination, can also be calculated which tells us the correlation between $x$ and $y^2$.
- It gives a value between 0 and 1
- 1 = model explains all of the variation in the data
- Closer to 1 is better
