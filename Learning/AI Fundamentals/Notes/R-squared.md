# R-squared
**Overview**
Description:: A measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line.

## Note

$R^2$ , the coefficient of determination, tells us the correlation between $x$ and $y$.
- It gives a value between 0 and 1
- At an $R^2$ of $1$, the model explains all of the variation in the data and therefore all of the data is along the fitted regression line.
