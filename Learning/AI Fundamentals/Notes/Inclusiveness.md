# Inclusiveness
**Overview**
Description:: AI may not work for everyone, if not inclusive.

## Note

AI has to be generalised and include everyone, otherwise solutions may not work for everyone.
> A predictive app provides no audio output for visually impaired users (inclusive whatever the gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc)
