# K-Nearest Neighbour
**Overview**
Description:: A classification that's based upon distance.

## Note

KNN is a [[Classification|classification]] model that works by using the distance between categories. It samples the data around it within a radius, $k$, and picks the most frequently occurring category within the radius.
### Choosing a good value for $k$

Note that if $k$ is too small, it may be sensitive to noise. Alternatively, if it's too large, it may include points from other classes. It's also important to choose an odd number for $k$, to eliminate ties.
