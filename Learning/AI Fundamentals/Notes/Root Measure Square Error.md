# Root Measure Square Error
**Overview**
Description:: A measure of estimated loss.

## Note

The RMSE tells us the estimated loss, so the incorrect predictions are roughly off by that RMSE.

The square root of the [[Mean Square Error]] gives the RMSE. However, the MSE cannot be used for comparison since it's squared.
