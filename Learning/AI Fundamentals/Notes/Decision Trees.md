# Decision Trees
**Overview**
Description:: Classification model inspired by binary trees.

## Note

Decision trees is a [[Classification|classification]] model that can be used both on linear and non-linear data, although it's commonly used on non-linear data.

The output produces a binary tree where each internal node is an attribute and the leaf nodes represent the classes. Each fork invokes a condition which will send the data either left or right.

The root node is a feature and is decided based upon [[Information gain|information gain]]. The feature with the highest information gain is used.
