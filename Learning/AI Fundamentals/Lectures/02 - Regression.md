## Introduction

Regression = an **algorithm** that creates a model to predict a model. It is **not** the model itself.
- Useful when little data is available
- Easy to interpret
- Robust
- Fast

- Input = Independent
- Output = Dependant 

It establishes a relationship between the features (inputs) and label (output).

## Types of regression

- Univariate (1 feature)
	- Linear
	- Non-Linear
- Multivariate (2+ features)
	- Linear
	- Non-Linear

## Splitting the dataset

- Training
	- Apply the algorithm to this split, to establish the relationship
- Validation
	- During training, generate predictions and compare to known
	- Can be used for model hyper-parameter tuning
- Test

## Pre-processing

- Transformation
	- Convert from text to numerical
- Cleaning
	- Remove duplicates
	- Deal with missing values (predict or remove data)
