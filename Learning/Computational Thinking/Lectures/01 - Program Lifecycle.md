# 01 - Program Lifecycle
**Overview**
Description:: 
Link:: 

## Lifecycle

There are 7 main points in the cycle:
- Objective
- Resources
- Ideation
- Selection
- Implementation
- Test/Evaluation
- Pivot

## Constraints

Over constraint - too many results in 0 solutions
Under constraint - not enough results in many solutions

## Objective

SMART objectives
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable (or Attainable)
- Relevant (or Realistic)
- ~~Time-Bound~~
- Clear (about your goals)

Have good goals.

## Coming up with good solutions

Ask **why**, but never more than 3 times.
