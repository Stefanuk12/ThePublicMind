# SMART objectives
**Overview**
Description:: A way of coming up with good goals.

## Note

SMART objectives provide a framework for coming up with well-rounded goals when trying to solve a problem.

The acronym stands for:
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable (or **A**ttainable)
- **R**elevant (or **R**ealistic)
- **T**imebound

However, my lecturer suggests that the *T* is irrelevant and should be replaced with **C**lear to emphasise the importance of clear goals.
