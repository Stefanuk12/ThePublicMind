# 05 - Relations and functions
**Overview**
Description::

## Connections

(x, y) = ordered pair where x owns y
- x = source
- y = target
Relation = set of ordered pairs
Domain = set of members in source set which get used
Range = set of members in the target set which get used

`x` = cross product = cartesian product

source set = set of departure
target set = set of destination = codomain

xRy = x is related to y using Relation R = R(x, y)

source can = target

identity relation = 

above is binary relations, you can have n-ary relations

functions $\subset$ relations, all functions are relations

functions = each member of the source set is only used once or not at all = for each domain member, only one target

total functions = all members in source set are used
partial function = not all members in source are used = $Domain()
