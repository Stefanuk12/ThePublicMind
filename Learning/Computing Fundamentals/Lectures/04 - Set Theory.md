## Section 1

- Listing all the members of a set is called: enumerating
- An item is a set is called an: element

$\in$ = is a member of

- Unnamed set is called an anonymous set
- Order does not matter
- All unique items, cannot have duplicates

$\emptyset$ or $\{ \}$  = empty set

$\cup$ = combine the two sets, removing duplicates
$\cap$ = get the common elements in both sets
\\ = all elements in the first set that is not in the second
$\subset$ = all element in the first set are in the second **and** the second has other stuff
$\subseteq$ = same as $\subset$ but the second requirement isn't needed
$\#$ = amount of elements
