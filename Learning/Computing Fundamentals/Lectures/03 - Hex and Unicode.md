# 03 - Hex and Unicode
**Overview**
Description::

## Hexadecimal

Base-16
- Easier to read, interpret and remember than binary
- Can be easily converted to binary and back
	- 1 byte = 2 hex digits

0-9 then A-F (to represent 10 to 15)

`h` in ASM on datum = hex

## ASCII

Many versions, we now use 1987 ver. Previous versions didn't have lowercase, `_`, etc.

- 7 bit, not 8 because old

## Unicode

- Successor to ASCII
- 21 bits, as many more aren't needed and allows storage optimisations

UTF-8 - variable length (VLA) from 1-4 bytes
