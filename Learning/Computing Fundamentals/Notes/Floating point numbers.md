# Floating point numbers
**Overview**
Description:: An overview of floating point numbers.

## Note

Floating point numbers allow computers to store fractions and much larger (or smaller) numbers. Usually, they're either [[Single precision FP|single precision]] (32 bits) or [[Double precision FP|double precision]] (64 bits).

### Warnings
 - Floats are never equal, e.g. `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 != 0.3`
 - Repeated calculations = more inaccurate
 - Don't use to count...
