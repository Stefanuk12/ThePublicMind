# Improper subset
**Overview**
Description:: The second set shares the same elements as the first.

## Note

Similar to [[Proper subset|proper subsets]], an improper subset ($\subseteq$) is where both sets share the same elements but the second [[Set|set]] may have additional members.

This means both sets could also be equal.
