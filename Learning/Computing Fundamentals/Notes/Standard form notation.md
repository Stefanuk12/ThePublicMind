# Standard form notation
**Overview**
Description:: What is standard form and the benefits/drawbacks?

## Note

In the form: `a * b^c` where
- a = significand
- b = base
- c = exponent

Allows compact and efficient way to represent small **and** large numbers.
- as long as they're not very precise...

Increase exponent = bigger number but less precise
Increase significand = smaller number but more precise

Therefore, can't be large and small at the same time.
- To get around this, store the "large" and "small" numbers separately
