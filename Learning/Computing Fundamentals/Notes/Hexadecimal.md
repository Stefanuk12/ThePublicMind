# Hexadecimal
**Overview**
Description:: Hexadecimal is an alternate and easier number system in base 16.

## Note

Hexadecimal is a way to represent numbers, but it has a base of **16**. A number with a leading `0x` or ending `h` may indicate it's in hex.

There are many benefits:
- easier to read, interpret, and remember (than binary)
- can easily be converted to and from binary, since 1 byte = 2 hex digits

To represent the digits from 10 to 15, the letters A to F are used accordingly.
