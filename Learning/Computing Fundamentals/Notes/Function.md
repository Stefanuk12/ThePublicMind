# Function
**Overview**
Description:: For each domain member, there is only one target.

## Note

A function is where each member of the source [[Set|set]] is only used once **or** not at all. In other words, for each domain member, there is only one target.

However, the entire source set could point to only one element in the target set - just not the other way around. It's a one-to-many relationship.

Therefore, functions $\subset$ [[Relation|relations]] so all functions are relations.
