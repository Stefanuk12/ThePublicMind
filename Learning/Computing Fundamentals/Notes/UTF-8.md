# UTF-8
**Overview**
Description:: Encoding method for Unicode via bytes.

## Note

UTF-8 tells the computer how to store [[Unicode]] characters. It can use 1-4 bytes, depending on the amount needed.

It uses variable length encoding to only encode the exact amount of space needed which allows the program to save on memory.
