# Extended ASCII
**Overview**
Description:: A version of ASCII with extra characters.

## Note

An extended version of [[ASCII]] which includes accents and extra characters. It achieves this by using 8 bits, instead of the regular 7.

It is **not** standardised and not recommended for modern code due to interfering with [[Unicode]]. It was used earlier in computing.
