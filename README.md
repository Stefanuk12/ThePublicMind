# The Public Mind

This repository contains only the "Learning" part of my private obsidian vault: TheMind. I am a Computer Science student at university, so I thought I would share my notes with everyone, and maybe someone will find them useful.

For the best experience, I recommend using Obsidian. I tried setting it up as a website, but the export tool didn't like the Dataview plugin and would not render the pages correctly.
